# EZ Stream Access - Browser Extension

Extension that streamlines your Twitch usage by saving you time opening your favorite channels.

Available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ez-stream-access/jjnclaliegbplphbgdcjmcepdmjhpokm) for Chromium-based browsers.

## Features

-   Save a few clicks by being able to open Twitch channels directly from the extension menu accessible from the browser toolbar.
-   Clicking on the thumbnail opens the channel with the video player covering the whole browser window. No chat or Twitch UI. Perfect for selecting streams to watch on your second monitor! EZ Stream Access also remembers the stream quality you selected in the popup. This saves you a few seconds you normally have to spend selecting your quality.
-   Clicking on the stream title or profile picture of the channel opens the normal channel page.
-   A click on the name of the streamer leads you to their videos page.
-   And a click on the game or category name opens the directory page.
